            Inception is one of my Favourite Movie. Inception is a mind blending movie with the concept of dreams.
            Inception is directed by Christopher Nolan.The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. 
            He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased, as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.
